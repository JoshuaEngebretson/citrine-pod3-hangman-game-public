# Hangman - Game Instructions:

## 1. Set up your computer:
First be sure that node is installed on your computer (you can do that here: https://nodejs.org/en). 

Then save this code file to your computer and open that folder in your terminal.

Next, you should be able to run "npm install" in your terminal for the necessary dependencies to run the game. 

## 2. Start the game: 
In the terminal, enter the following command to start the game: `npm start`

## 3. Gameplay:
Now you can play hangman! Type "yes" into your terminal to proceed with gameplay. You will be prompted to guess a letter for a secret word. 

If you guess incorrectly, you will be informed how many chances remain. If you guess correctly, the letter will appear in the secret word and you can continue guessing. 

If you run out of guesses (you can guess incorrectly a total of 6 times per game) then the game will inform you of the secret word and you could play again.

You win the game by guessing the secret word before you are out of chances. 

Good luck!
